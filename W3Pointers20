/*
Our Code Gym! problem of the week. Please note, we did have some difficulty understanding the initial problem below, but we feel this is what the author is looking for.

Participants: Lloyd, Jeffrey, R.J.

Write a program in C to show a pointer to an array which contents are pointer to structure. Go to the editor
Expected Output :





Exmployee Name : Alex
Employee ID : 1002
*/





#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>



typedef struct employee
{
char name[20];
int id;
} employee;



int main()
{
employee e_arr[3];
employee *ptr0 = &e_arr[0];
strcpy (e_arr->name, "Bob");
e_arr -> id = 10022628;

printf ("Employee name: \t%s\n", e_arr->name);
printf ("Employee ID: \t%d\n", e_arr->id);
return 0;
}
